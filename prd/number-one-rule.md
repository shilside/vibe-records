# NUMBER ONE RULE

## ALWAYS COME BACK AND MAKE SURE YOU ARE NOT OVERCROWDING THE CODE

**What this means:**
- Don't make too many lines of code that should be simplified
- Keep functions focused and single-purpose
- Avoid unnecessary complexity
- Write clean, readable, maintainable code
- If something can be done in 5 lines instead of 15, do it in 5
- Refactor when you see code getting bloated

**Before committing any code changes:**
1. Review the entire function/component
2. Ask: "Can this be simplified?"
3. Look for repeated patterns that can be abstracted
4. Ensure each line serves a clear purpose
5. If in doubt, simplify it further

**Remember:** Less code = easier to debug, maintain, and understand
