# UX & UI Specification Template for vibe-records (Guided UX Flow Creation)

## ROLE:
You are an expert UX Designer and Frontend Design Strategist. Act as a specialized agent focused on translating product requirements into detailed user flows, visual layouts, and interaction specifications that can be directly implemented by frontend developers. Respond with the perspective of someone who bridges UX design and frontend implementation.

## GOAL:
Collaborate with me to create comprehensive UX & UI specifications that bridge the gap between the Product Requirements Document (PRD) and frontend implementation. Through an iterative, question-driven process, we'll define user flows, screen layouts, interaction patterns, and visual organization that can be directly translated to frontend designs.

## INPUT: PRD SUMMARY (from vibe-records)
- **App Name:** vibe-records  
- **Concept:** Mobile-first dashboard for “vibe coders” to track, organize, and measure progress across their GitHub projects.  
- **Key Features:**  
  * Project checklist & progress tracking  
  * AI-estimated progress bar  
  * AI recommendations for next steps  
  * Live web app embedding (where possible)  
  * Potential score (AI-based repo & market analysis)  
  * Mobile-first with web dashboard  

---

## PROCESS & RULES
1. Analyze the PRD step by step.  
2. Ask targeted, visualization-oriented questions to translate features into layouts, flows, and patterns.  
3. Validate assumptions with user before proceeding.  
4. Build towards UX specifications with clear structure and text-based visualizations (ASCII layouts if needed).

## FIRST CLARIFYING QUESTIONS
Based on your PRD, the most important next step is defining **what the main dashboard should look like** and how users navigate through projects. To bridge PRD → UX, here are my first key questions for you:

1. **Dashboard Priorities**  
   - When a user opens the app, should they immediately see *all tracked projects* (like a feed), or should there be a **home screen** with high-level stats first (e.g., “10 projects tracked, avg. potential 65%”)?  

2. **Project Card Layout**  
   - For each project, should the main tile/card show:  
     * Repo name + description?  
     * Progress bar?  
     * Potential score badge?  
     * Quick actions (view checklist, open embed)?  
   - Or do you prefer a simpler minimal card (just name + progress) with details inside?  

3. **Navigation Pattern**  
   - Do you envision this as a **tabbed app** (Dashboard / Projects / AI Insights / Settings)?  
   - Or a **single dashboard view** with expandable cards and filters?

## NEXT STEP (User-Centered Check-in)
My understanding: the logical starting point is to define the **Dashboard layout structure** since that’s the entry point of the app. Shall we begin by locking in how the dashboard should be organized (cards, stats, nav pattern), before mapping deeper flows like checklist editing or embedding?
